<h2>The Purpose Of Movie Websites</h2>
<h3 class="a2">It can be an interesting experience looking around at websites in particular 
industries to identify trends and see how they differ from those in other industries.
 In this article, weâ€™ll take a look at the websites of major motion pictures to see what
 types of websites are being created. Movies are a big part of the entertainment industry,
 and in recent years their websites have become increasingly critical to their overall success.
 Obviously, in order for a movie to be financially successful, it needs to do well at the box office,
 and today many moviegoers use the Internet to find movies to see and to buy tickets.
 Having things like trailers and other video clips helps to engage visitors and encourages
 them to find show times and buy tickets online.</h3><br>
